<h4>1. Fire Accident</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>All employers are obliged to
assess the risk of fire in their workplace. Below listed are the procedures
that needs be followed during an emergency of fire accident. Each and every
staff of Datapage should have the knowledge of the below mentioned points. The
correct number and type of fire extinguisher has been provided and maintained
by competent engineers. It is imperative that the right fire extinguisher is
deployed against a certain type of fire. Using water on an oil based fire for
instance will not only endanger the person attempting to fight the fire but
will also help its spread. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>A fire brigade has been formed to
handle any emergency situations in Datapage. Vairamurthy (HR & Administration Officer) will be leading this team. Any instances of fire in the office

</span></span>Storm and Flooding</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Unlike other natural disasters,
storm and floods can be predicted beforehand. Hence, precautionary measures and
recovery plans can be thought of well in advance before the actual strike of
the disaster. The following are the procedures that should be followed before
and after a storm or floods.</span></p>

<h5>2.2 Storm and Flood Emergency Procedures</h5>

<li>Notify municipal and state officials of our activity, in case they have special concerns</li>
<li>Alert all employees, so they'll be ready to respond to any adverse situations</li>
<li>Secure your area and vital records</li>
<li>Prepare to receive and comply with directions from Emergency Personnel.</li>

<li>If directed to evacuate, do so immediately</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span style='text-decoration:none'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Verdana, Arial"'>
</span></span>Earthquake</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Earthquakes strike without
warning so it is important that a specific procedure is followed during and
after its strike to minimise its impact. When an earthquake occurs, the solid
earth may pitch and roll like the deck of a ship for several minutes. 
Earthquakes strike without warning and there will be only seconds to react.
Most casualties result from falling debris and objects, splintering window
glass, and fire.  The chances of being injured during an earthquake will be
reduced if the following procedures are adhered to during the earthquake.</span></p>

<h5>3.1 Earthquake Emergency Procedures</h5>

<ul>
<li>When an earthquake is felt, duck under a sturdy table or desk</li>
<li>Stay away from windows, bookcases, file cabinets, tall furniture, heavy mirrors, hanging plants, and other heavy objects that could fall</li>
<li>Watch out for falling plaster or ceiling tiles.</li>
<li>Stay under cover until the shaking stops</li>
<li>If no table or desk is available, seek cover against an interior wall and protect your head and neck with your arms.</li>
<li>Hold onto the table or desk</li>
<li>If it moves, move with it.  Hold the position until the ground stops shaking and it is safe to move</li>
<li>Do not use elevators</li>
<li>Do not be surprised if the fire alarm sounds or sprinkler systems come on</li>
<li>Remain under cover for a few minutes and prepare for the possibility of after-shocks</li>
<li>If the building appears to have significant damage evacuate to a safe location, until emergency personnel advises you of the ability to return to your work location</li>
<li>Replace telephone receivers back on the telephone cradle</li>
<li>Check your work area for injured employees and give first aid as may be deemed appropriate</li>
<li>Seek medical treatment as may be required</li>
<li>Do not attempt to move injured persons unless they are in immediate danger</li>
<li>Check for fire hazards</li>
<li>Do not smoke or light matches</li>
<li>Do not turn on lights or other electrical circuits until you are certain that there is no risk of gas leaks</li>
<li>Remain calm and assess your situation carefully</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span style='text-decoration:none'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Verdana, Arial"'>
</span></span>Evacuation Procedures</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The following are the general
evacuation procedures that should be followed when ordered to evacuate the building
during disasters.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>If safe, secure vital records and shut down electrical equipment</li>
<li>Proceed to your alternate exit if necessary</li>
<li>Shut all doors as you leave</li>
<li>Floor staff should ensure that all staff and visitors evacuate the area</li>
<li>Assist disabled employees or visitors</li>
<li>Proceed quietly and orderly</li>
<li>Do not use elevators</li>
<li>Do not open door if hot or if smoke is present</li>
<li>Once outside, assemble at a designated area and stay there; your supervisors will need to have a tally of their personnel</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='color:black'>It is very
likely that evacuations will involve disabled individuals. The following will
be helpful in safe evacuation and communication during an emergency. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Persons having mobility
impairments may or may not use wheelchairs. Those individuals having mo­bility
impairment, who can ambulate in varying degrees, will need to be carried down
stairs, or other­wise be assisted. Ask her/him for instructions. Always consult
wheelchair users about: </span></p>

<ul>
<li>Transferring her/him from the wheelchair (or, if the emergency dictates, moving the person down stairs while staying in the wheelchair)</li>
<li>Never carry an individual backwards down a flight of stairs</li>
<li>The number of people needed for assistance</li>
<li>Be aware that some wheelchair users use catheter leg bags, braces, oxygen, prosthetics, etc. </li>

<h5>Preferred Leave</h5>

<p>Twelve days of PL can be availed in a calendar year after obtaining prior approval in writing from Reporting Coordinator/Manager in a specified format. Advance notice should be given to all leave one wishes to avail.</p>


Leave	Advance Notice to be Given

<h5>Sick Leave</h5>

<p>In a calendar year, each confirmed employee is eligible to avail 5 days. The employee has to produce Medical Certificate if he/she takes leave for more than 2 consecutive days.   </p>


<h5>Maternity Leave </h5>

<p>This scheme is applicable to all married female employees, who have worked for a minimum of 240 days in the preceding 12 months before the date of proceeding on maternity leave. The Maternity Leave entitlement spans for 12 weeks with pay (6 weeks pre-maternity and 6 weeks post-maternity).  In addition, the employee can avail leave without pay for a maximum period of 2 months in case of illness (of mother and/or child) arising out of delivery.</p>

<h5>Compensatory Off</h5>

<p>Comp-off can be considered on approval from Senior Manager only on special instances. The following conditions will be applicable for availing comp-off:</p>

<li>Production Managers should approve OT based on day-to-day production demands.</li>
<li>The staff can avail OT only if they extend for a minimum of 2 hours excluding break timings.</li>
<li>Overtime will be applicable only up to SPSO level.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Training/Probationary Period</h5>

<p>No employee is eligible to avail leave till their successful confirmation. All leave taken during the probation period shall be treated as loss of pay. Prior sanction of leave (if any taken) is mandatory. Once the staff are moved to production, proportionate leave is applicable.</p>


<h5>Absence from Work</h5>

<p>An employee who stays away from duty without prior permission or approval will be noted for unauthorized absence and the leave will be treated as LOP.</p>

<p>The mere fact that an employee submits a leave application form would not entitle him/her for leave if it has not been approved and sanctioned by the immediate reporting Coordinator/Manager.</p>

<p>Non-submission of leave letters for availed leave (even though permitted) will also lead to Loss of Pay (LOP).</p>


<h4>5. Probation, Confirmation and Performance Appraisal</h4>

<p>All employees will be on probation for the period specified in the appointment letter.</p>
<p>All probation staff will be deemed to be confirmed in their job or post only when he/she is intimated of this fact in writing by the HR department.</p>
<p>An employee may be confirmed after 6 months from the date of his/her joining the company based on the feedback from their respective managers. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, behavior or attitude during the probation period, the management will monitor the staff closely and decide on the future course of action in accordance with the provisions in the appointment letter. If the management considers necessary, the probation period may be extended. Employment may cease to exist if an employee is not confirmed after 3 consecutive months of probation extension.</p>


<h5>Performance Appraisal</h5>

<p>The purpose is to review subsequent performance in order to reinforce successful behaviors, correct shortfalls and plan development activity. The process also ensures that everyone knows that the employee contributes to business objectives. This is applicable to all employees on company rolls. Following are the processes involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>All employees will be apprised after 12 months of their date of joining. </li>
<li>HR has to forward the name list of staff due for appraisal/review and the Performance Appraisal Form to the Manager in the first week of every month.</li>
<li>Manager/Coordinator will assess the staff and have a discussion with the employee and send the assessment to HR.</li>
<li>HR will prepare the appraisal letter and release it to the employee.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Exit Formalities</h4>

<p>If the employee wishes to leave, he/she should address the resignation letter to the immediate Manager. Manager/Departmental Head should endeavor to persuade the employee to reconsider the decision if he/she has been a consistently good performer.  The Department Head would forward the same to HR with recommendations on the date of release and notice period details.</p>

<p>All employees on completion of their notice period of their resignation will have to get the <b>No Dues form</b> signed by their reporting Superior and from other department heads on the last day of leaving the organisation, failing which their dues will not be cleared by the Management</p>

<p>HR will be the coordinator for all dealings with the employee in exit-related matters.</p>


<h5>Notice Period</h5>

<p>The contractual notice period for leaving the services of the company will be as defined in the appointment letter.  Normally, the company will insist full notice period to be served; however, in some cases, the company reserves the right to release an employee earlier, waiving the notice period partially or fully.</p>

<p>For the purposes of computing the notice period, a month will constitute 30 calendar days.  The notice period will be counted from the date of receipt of the resignation letter.  Where an employee wishes to leave the services of the company without serving the full notice period, he/she will be liable to pay the company salary in lieu of the unserved portion of the notice period. Loyalty Bonus deducted every month will not be paid back if the employee has not completed the minimum period of 12 months. Leave is not permissible during the notice period.</p>

<p>The decision to waiver notice period will require the approval of HR based on the recommendation from the concerned Department Head.</p>

<p>Employees who tender formal resignation letters will need to follow the company's rules for the notice period. It is in company's discretion to request a notice period from such employees taking into consideration the importance of their roles and responsibilities. These employees will get their full and final settlement including salary and relieving letter within 45 working days from their last working day in the company.</p>


<h5>Exit Interview</h5>

<p>Prior to the employee leaving the services of the company, HR will conduct an exit interview with the employee. The purpose of the exit interview is to identify reasons for leaving and obtain feedback on their experience with Datapage, and to improve working conditions, wherever necessary. </p>

<h5>Income- Tax savings u/s 80C – Rs.1,00,000 per annum</h5>
<p>A self-declaration statement (provisional) from the individual concern should be submitted to the Finance department on or before October 25th of every year in order to derive the tax liability.</p>
<p>A final declaration needs to be submitted on or before February 25th of every year and this will be considered as final for computing the tax liability. Further to this period no other statements and declarations will be accepted.</p>
<p>All the relevant enclosures and supporting documents should be given on or before March 10th of every year in order to assess the eligible and entitled amount as per the Income Tax Act. The final enclosures (photocopies of insurance premium payment receipts, rent receipts and other entitled supporting documents) should be handed over on or before April 15th of every year, whereby the Form 16 will be issued. </p>
<p>Form 16 will be processed as a procedure only for those who pay tax. For others who need Form 16, a requisition letter will need to be submitted to the accounts department.</p>

<h5>Overtime Calculation</h5>

<ul><li>Basic pay x 12 months / 44 hours x 52 weeks in a year = OT cost per hour</li></ul>
<p>All staff in the gross salary slab of Rs.17,000/- pm and above (SPSO, PCO, DM, PL, TL, developers) will not be eligible for OT.</p>

<h5>Loss Of Pay</h5>

<p>LOP calculation is done on the gross salary. LOP = Gross pay (per month) *12 months / 44 hrs per week * 52 weeks during a year * normal working hours. The derived amount will be deducted from the basic pay.</p>

<h5>Increments</h5>

<p>Salary increment will be effected only on the Special Allowance component and all other  components including the basic pay will remain the same every year.</p>

<h5>Full & Final Settlement Calculation</h5>

<p>HR will need to supply to accounts the details of leave entitled/availed. Any excess leave availed during the calendar year and any amount payable by the employee will be adjusted from his/her full and final settlement amount.</p>

<h5>Corporate Salary Account</h5>

<p>Our corporate salary account is processed via the HDFC Bank. The account opening form will be given by the HR along with other joining formalities.</p>

<p>The bank’s helpdesk telephone no. is 044-66003333.</p>


<h5>Labour Welfare Fund </h5>

<p>There is a yearly contribution towards LWF @ Rs. 7 each from the employee and Rs. 14 each from the employer in the December pay.</p>

<h5>Ex-gratia Payment</h5>

<p>This is payable once a year during Diwali festival for all live and confirmed staff. Only staff under the slab of 30,000 Rs. will be eligible for the exgratia payment. Staff on notice period and/or resigned employees will not be eligible for exgratia payment.</p>
<p>Following is the calculation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Staff completing 3 years service and above – full basic pay</li>
<li>Staff completing 2 years service and above – 15 days basic pay</li>
<li>Staff completing 1 year service and above – 7 days basic pay</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>The administration
has insured the resources of the company under this policy. The details of the
clauses covered under the policy are as follows:</span></p>

covers damages caused by the impact of natural perils such as fire, flood,
earthquake, water perils, Tsunami. The entire floor and all the contents are
covered under this policy. </span><span lang=EN-AU>In case of an accident in
the business premises due to the above natural perils, any damage to the
resources and contents of the company such as systems, servers, furniture,
fittings, etc. will be compensated by the insurance company if a claim is
raised under the “Fire and Perils” clause coverage. The insurance company would
reimburse the claim within 7–10 working days.</span></p>

clause covers damages caused by burglary (forcible entry &amp; exit),
housebreaking and dacoity. </span><span lang=EN-AU>In case of burglary or
dacoity in the business premises, the loss incurred will be paid by the
insurance company if a claim is raised under the “Burglary and Dacoity” clause
coverage. The insurance company would reimburse the claim within 7–10 working
days.</span></p>

towards an alternative office is covered in case there is any major damage to
the site. </span><span lang=EN-AU>In case of natural disasters like earthquake,
circumstances of a total shutdown of the working onsite premises may occur. In
such instances, on an </span><span lang=EN-GB style=''>admissible

towards the setting up of an alternative office premises. </span><span
lang=EN-GB>The claim is payable up to a maximum period of 12 months or the
actual period, whichever is less.</span></p>

forms, police reports, loss assessment reports and quotations&nbsp;for the
processing of claim. </span><strong><span lang=EN-GB style='

administration has a set up of fire alarm installed in the office premises. The
device is a perfect functioning and active 24x7 days. The device has three
hooters installed at three places in the premises which would produce high dB
sound in case of fire. The main panel which has been installed in the front
office is being monitored and maintained every fortnight. A register, which
holds the details of the date of inspection, the inspector’s name and his
remarks, is being maintained by the security personnel. The fire alarms have
also been covered under AMC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-AU>In case of a fire
accident in the business premises, the fire alarms would start buzzing. This
would alert the staff and other people in the premises regarding the fire
accident. The staff could be shifted to a safe area away from the fire. The
alert would also initiate the next set of actions to be performed like locating
the fire and putting it off.</span></p>

in the office premises would be the use of fire extinguishers. </span><span
lang=EN-AU>There are totally eight fire extinguishers present in the office
premises. To be more specific, a fire extinguisher has been set up for every
825 sq ft of area. Six out of the eight extinguishers are of ABC (powder type)
model which can be used for putting off fire anywhere except on delicate
electronic goods such as systems, servers etc, as the goods may be unusable
after the exposure to the powder. The other two extinguishers are of CO</span><sub><span

lang=EN-AU>The building and the office premises are both guarded on a 24x7
basis by well-trained security personnel, who restrict the entry of any
unauthorised person into the building and office premises. The security
personnel check the outgoing and incoming material and keep a log in order to
avoid any kind of theft or burglary. The security personnel have been provided
with the escalation procedures and a telephone directory with all relevant
phone numbers in order to handle an emergency situation by contacting the right
person at the right time. He is also given the access to the common key vault
containing the duplicate keys to different cabins, so as to deal with any
disaster occurring inside a locked cabin.</span></p>

lang=EN-AU>The entry into the business premises is also restricted by the
Biometric Access Control System installed at the front door of the office. The
system would recognise only authorised thumb impressions which have already
been fed as templates into the database. The access through this system would
be possible only by the recognition of the thumb impression by the system. As a
second level protection layer, any unauthorised entry to the production floor
could be prevented by the Biometric Access Control System. This could greatly
avoid burglary and dacoity.</span></p>

in case of interruptions in the supply of raw power. An electrician has been
appointed to look after the fuel needs and maintenance of the generator. This
generator could support the entire business process for any number of days
until the raw power supply is restored, provided it is fed in with the required
fuel.</span></p>

load. One is a 20 KVA UPS and the other is a 6 KVA UPS. We have a special set
up where one of these UPS has been dedicated for critical systems, server,
access control, which works in ‘hot-standby’ mode. This ‘hot-standby’ mode
allows the UPS supporting critical systems to work off the main UPS and in the
event of failure of the main UPS, independently supports critical systems. In
this effect it forms a double layer of power backup for critical systems. The
UPS has the ability to work as a complete power backup for 1 hour. The UPS has
been covered under AMC and support. The response time from the AMC office is 1
hour from the time of launch of the complaint. With the help of these 2 UPS set
up, any type of power failure could be easily handled for at least 1 hour. </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Suggestions</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>In addition to the
already existing recovery plans, following are some suggestions which could be
put in place for a speedy recovery from any disaster:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Offsite
Facility</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – An offsite facility is a location
outside the onsite premises. It should not be located in the same building or
area as the onsite facility. The offsite facility should possess a minimum
infrastructure support to continue the business process such as power, UPS,
generator, systems, servers, etc. The offsite facility should also have the
infrastructure protection policies such as fire extinguishers, fire alarms,
restricted access, emergency exits and trained security personnel. The offsite
facility can be used for the storage of backups, licensing document duplicates,
source code backups, application software backups, confidential document
duplicates. It can also serve as a backup in case of a sudden shut down of the
onsite premises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-AU>Insurance
coverage for Terrorist attack</span></i></b><b><span lang=EN-AU> </span></b><span
lang=EN-AU>– Terrorist attack has very well become a part of the manmade
disasters in the present world. It is wise to plan for the recovery from such
disasters. One such way is to get the company resources covered under the
terrorist attack clause. By holding such a policy, any damage to the company
resources caused by terrorist attacks can be handled by the compensation
received from the insurance company on an admissible claim. The insurance
company would reimburse the claim within 7–10 working days, which could be used
for the resumption of the business processes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-AU>Insurance
coverage for Equipments</span></i></b><span lang=EN-AU> – It is very important
that the electronic equipments and gadgets such as 3B2 dongles, Athena dongles
etc., which are essential for the business process, are insured. The policy
should cover impacts on these equipments due to natural disasters such as fire,
earthquake etc. By holding such a policy, any damage to the equipments can be
handled by the compensation received from the insurance company on an
admissible claim. The claim should be supported by documents such as the
invoice of the equipment and the first information report issued by the police
regarding the disaster and damage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-AU>Insurance
coverage for Printers and Photocopier</span></i></b><span lang=EN-AU> – The insurance
coverage for printers and photocopier has not been taken up by Datapage as they
have been hired from vendors. It is advisable to insist the vendors to cover
the printers and photocopiers under relevant clauses and inform them that
Datapage would not be responsible for any damage to these resources.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>Information
technology has become the backbone of most of the business processes of the
modern age. This is because of the efficiency, accuracy, speed and control of
information services. Organizations are more dependent on their information
services in normal business operations. If the information systems break down,
there would be a major set back in the progress of the business process, thus
leading to an adverse effect on the relationship with the clients. It is always
ideal to plan for recovery from disasters and major threats to the information technology
of a company. Following sections detail on the disaster recovery plans to
overcome hurdles occurring in the IT division of the company.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Data Protection Policies</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Access
Denied for Duplicating Data</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – The staff have
been denied access to duplicate any data from their workstations. This is done
by disabling the CD/DVD/USB writing devices of their systems. This would
greatly help in avoiding movement of important data out of the office premises
and any unwanted or unauthorised data being loaded into the company’s system.
This in turn would also protect the network from virus and worm threats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Restricted
Access to Server and Server Room</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>– The access to the working servers have been restricted by the
enforcement of rights to the staff. This would help in encapsulation of data
and staff would be restricted from accessing information irrelevant to their
profile. The access to the server room has also been restricted by allowing
access only to authorised IT staff. A key-log, which has the name, entry and
exit details of the person accessing the server room in the absence of the
administrators, is being maintained by the security personnel. Only Team
Leaders are allowed access under such circumstances and are accompanied by
security personnel. Prior access permission is obtained according to IT
escalation procedures under such circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Fire and
Damage Proof Data Storage Cabinets</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – The data
from the server are backed up on cartridges and tapes. The tapes, cartridges,
software CDs, and licenses are stored in fire and damage proof cabinets
specially designed to withstand any kind of impact caused by fire, wall
collapse, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Monitored
Internet/FTP/email Access</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – The access to the
Internet, FTP and email are being regularly monitored. This is done by
monitoring the log created for each employee accessing the Internet/FTP/email
facilities provided. This would protect the network from unauthorised data and
movement of data out of the company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Usage of
Proxy Server</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>– The
Internet access is restricted to the users by the usage of proxy server. The
proxy server would restrict the access to authorised sites only. This would
also log the user access details. The log will be monitored on a regular basis.
This would help to prevent suspicious data transfer activity both to and from
local systems.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Data Backup Procedures</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>One of the effective
ways to tackle disasters in IT is by planning efficient data backup procedures.
The major threat to the IT department is the loss of data during disasters.
This threat could be overcome by having powerful backup procedures in place.
The following are the backup procedures followed by Datapage:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'>Dedicated Backup Server</span></i></b><span
lang=EN-GB> – A dedicated backup server has been set up to replicate and backup
data from the working server. This works on a 24-hour delay basis. The data
from the working server would be replicated and copied to the backup server
every night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'><i>Storage Tapes</i></span></b><span
lang=EN-GB> – The data on the working server is stored into cartridge tapes on
a weekly basis. This serves as a second level backup. At any point of time,
data modified before a weeks’ time will be present in the tapes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'><i>Raid5 Technique</i> </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>– One of the powerful techniques for data backup being used
worldwide is the Raid5 technique. The data parity via Raid5 on the working
server helps greatly during hard disk failure of the main server. Raid5 works
on the parity and stripping principle. Data on the server will be stored in
four different drives and a pointer pointing to the addresses of these storage
locations would be present in all the drives. In case of failure of one of the
drives, the data stored in that drive would be recovered from the other three
working drives with the help of the pointer. Hence, the data recovery in case
of emergencies would be very quick and authentic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'>Periodic Backup Practice</span></i></b><span
lang=EN-GB> – There is a practice of periodic backup of important information
such as application source code, duplicated data, application CDs, and license
information. The vital information can hence be retrieved from the backup tapes
in case of emergencies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'>E-mail Server Backup</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>– A procedure to backup the settings, rules
and accounts of the email server is in place. The backup is done on a different
server and not in the same email server. In case of any emergencies or failure
of the email server, the backup email server immediately works as an alternate
solution as it is the exact replica of the email server.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i>Periodic Financial Data
Backup</i></b> – A periodic backup procedure has been put in place for
financial data. Any financial data residing in the Finance Manager’s system is
being periodically backed up into CDs/DVDs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i>Four Server Backup</i></b>
– The data from the working server is being backed up to four backup servers.
Hence, a pool of four servers is functioning as backups for the main server
during downtimes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'>Parallel Web and Database
Server on Standby</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – The web and the database
servers have a parallel standby facility. This would greatly minimise the
downtime of these servers and allow quicker redundancy during crisis.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Hardware Protection Policies</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Warranty
Coverage</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>– All the
systems, servers, printers, scanners and UPS of the company are purchased under
warranty coverage. The responsibility of any damage or malfunctioning of the
hardware will be taken up by the product supplier and will be replaced within
24 hours of time from the launch of complaint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Annual
Maintenance Contract</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>–
All the systems, servers, printers, scanners, MACs and UPS of the company are
covered under AMC. The coverage includes regular monitoring of the hardware for
effective functioning, complete maintenance check-up at regular intervals,
replacement of parts in case of damages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Surge
Protectors</span></i></b><i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></i><span lang=EN-GB>– The
inflow of power into the company has been routed through main circuit breaker
(MCB) switches and UPS. Hence, any sudden flow of high voltage would be first
handled by the MCB switch as this would trip and cut the power supply at once.
As a second layer of protection, the fuse in the UPS would burn and in turn
would cut the power supply. These methods would protect the hardware from high
voltage impact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Firewall</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>– A firewall is a protection layer of a
network or a gateway that limits access between networks in accordance with
local security policy. A firewall has been set up in our network which will
protect the network from virus threats, worm threats and intrusions. This acts
as a first level protection layer of the network. This plays a very important
role in minimising virus and worm threats to our network. The log created by
the firewall is regularly monitored to identify any unauthorised network
intrusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Control
Access Router</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – This router is responsible for
routing data across networks and is controlled by access policies. This enables
to have a controlled access to the network. The access can be controlled based
on IP address, port or both. Hence the router will not allow any unauthorised
entry or exit in the network.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>System-level
Virus Protection</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – A system-level virus
protection has been provided to all systems and servers in the network. This is
known as Desktop Protection. This virus protection would scan any new file copied
to the system at any point of time. This would avoid instances of any virus
attacks to the systems and servers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Up-to-date
Automatic Security Patching</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – Patching is a fix
to a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/p/program.html"><span
style='color:windowtext;'>program</span></a> <a
href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/p/bug.html"><span style='color:windowtext;

style='font:7.0pt '>
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Suggestions</span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-GB style='text-indent:.25in'>Data Backup to be done in
Dublin</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – In addition to all the backup
procedures in place, a weekly or fortnightly backup of data should be done in
Dublin which will ensure data protection to a maximum extent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Backup of
Email Correspondence</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – A periodic backup of all
email correspondence on important systems including the mail rules set and
contacts is a very useful practice to be put in place. This would enable
quicker recovery of the inbox and the communication would be restored much
faster. This would also avoid having to set the mail rules again and create the
contact list from the scratch in the event of email crash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Server
Registry Backup</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>– The
registry is the control system of a computer. Any software of a system would
work only if the registry has an entry to it. When a new software is installed
in the system, the registry information is updated accordingly. In case of
registry failure in the server, all the software that has been installed would
be disabled. This would work only when they are reinstalled and this is
time-consuming. In case of periodic server registry backup, the registry
information could be restored from the backup and the time spent for
reinstallation of software can be saved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>User Account
Backup</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>– Any member of
the network should have a user account of the network to work. The security
policies are also enforced based on these user accounts. In case of an
emergency, the restoration of the user account from the scratch would be
time-consuming. Hence a periodic user account backup would greatly reduce the
time taken to restore the user accounts and its settings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Backup
Internet Connectivity</span></i></b><span lang=EN-GB> – At present our company
has only one dedicated high-speed connectivity provided by one of the leading
Indian ISPs, covered by SLAs. But in case of failures in this connection, we
need to have a backup Internet connectivity line in order to continue the business
processes. An alternate connectivity is necessary for hosting servers and
important systems. This will help in avoiding communication gaps with the
customer and to maintain the schedule in dispatches even in emergency
situations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>Domain Level
Virus and Intrusion Protection</span></i><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>– A domain level virus and intrusion protection is necessary for a
network. Datapage maintains a system level virus protection procedure, which
would detect a virus only after it reaches the system. This means that the
virus has already entered our network. This would be a risk factor to the
network. By having a domain level virus and intrusion protection layer, the
virus and any intrusion would be eradicated before entering into the network.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i><span lang=EN-GB>AMC Renewal</span></i></b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i>Training</i></b><b>
</b>– DR Team needs to get trained in the usage of fire extinguishers and then
volunteers from the staff need to be chosen and trained as well. DR team also
should meet and layout a clear plan to organize evacuation procedures and any
required training to overcome panic during crisis. All the staff should have a
copy of Section 5.3 of this document and DR team members in each team should
explain the details further to their respective teams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><b><i>Testing – </i></b>As
a mode of testing the situation-handling abilities of the staff, mock crisis
situations should be created and the staff response and reactions towards the
situation should be studied. The results of the study would obviously suggest
the training needs. </p>
